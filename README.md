# Cark Park System (Java)
 
#1. Analysis & Specification
- Implement a car parking system that records which cars are currently parked in the car park. 
- Only registered cars must be allowed to enter the car park so the system must be able to keep a list of authorized vechiles (name of the owners) as well as thoose actually parked at the particular time.

The system must be able to provide a series of reports, for example indication whether or not the car park is full, displaying lists of registered vechiles and those parked.
